- `/etc/default/grub.`
- Part of grub is installed on the MBR/ESP partition. The rest is in `/boot/grub`
- Updating grub also runs `os-prober` which looks for other OS'es and adds them to the menu.
````
sudo grub-install -V       #check GRUB version
ls -l /boot/grub/          #list GRUB config
sudo update-grub           #making changes effective
sudo update-grub2          #symbolic link to "update-grub"
