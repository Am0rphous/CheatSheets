  - Problem with SSL such as: `invalid ssl routines pem lib`. Try clicking at the menu bar "Change Settings" and disable/enable SSL -> Reload and start [source](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier/issues/1421).
  - On the client: Mark "Client (use another computer's...)" and enter the server IP and click "Start". If it's not working, ping between the IPs and check with "tcpdump port 24800" on botch machines.


## Networking
- [Network-info by Peter-Moller](https://github.com/Peter-Moller/network-info) - A bash script for OS X that details information about the network.
- [Open-ports by Peter-Moller](https://github.com/Peter-Moller/open-ports) - A bash-script for OS X and Linux detailing the open network connections to and from a computer.
````
sudo airportd en0 info
sudo airportd en0 sniff 1
sudo airportd scan                                   #scans for WiFi networks and prints results. Requires sudo.
sudo netstat -ap tcp
sudo netstat -anvp tcp | awk 'NR<3 || /LISTEN/'      #shows sweet list of listening ports
sudo lsof -PiTCP -sTCP:LISTEN
sudo lsof -Pn -i4
sudo lsof -Pn -i4 | grep LISTEN
sudo tcpdump -Ii en0
````
- DNS
````powershell
sudo lsof -iTCP:53 -iUDP:53 -n              # make sure mDNSRespo is running
````
  - Clear the DNS cache
````powershell
dscacheutil -flushcache
sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder;sudo killall mDNSResponderHelper;sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
````
- Proxychains-ng
Installation
````powershell
brew install proxychains-ng       #config: /usr/local/etc/proxychains.conf
proxychains4 curl ifconfig.me
proxychains4 ssh@server.com
proxychains4 nmap ip
````
Be aware: Sometimes you may encounter no IP change, e.g.
````powershell
proxychains4 curl ifconfig.me
[proxychains] config file found: /usr/local/etc/proxychains.conf
[proxychains] preloading /usr/local/Cellar/proxychains-ng/4.14/lib/libproxychains4.dylib
(PUBLIC-IP-HERE)  
````
By copying the executable to another location, we resolve this. E.g. `cp /usr/local/bin/wget /tmp/`
Then run:
````powershell
proxychains4 /tmp/wget https://google.com
````
